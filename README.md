# KV-RAT-CPP
# This branch is currently the testing branch for a new rework of the rat. Meant to be easily used and what not.
# I will update this readme with more information in the near future.
## If you want to use the server based code on linux, preferably run it via this https://github.com/TheSaltyNewfie/kv-rat-cpp-linux-server or possibly via wine (This is untested)
