# KV-RAT-CPP
## What is this?
This is a complete overhaul of the KV-RAT program **completely** in C++
### Why?
I started to remake the client within C++ and ran into issues with handling data between the server that is in python to the client which is now in C++. So I decided to recreate both the server and the client using the SFML Library for networking.
I also decided this was best since now I don't have to swap back and forth with languages and can keep it relatively simple to read and understand.

And as usual a disclaimer
## Disclaimer
Before I continue, **This was made for educational purposes and I am not liable for what you use this software for and what happens.  **I am not responsible for any thing people use this for. I made it to learn and I intend to never use it for bad intentions**

## How to use
- To build the project, download the source code in its entirety and then build which ever solution is needed, if needed, you may need to get/update some of the packages though nuget.
- If you don't want to build the project yourself, there should be a somewhat up to date version in the releases tab
## What's to come?
### ~1 month
- File checker
- File updater (On startup if selected in settings)
- FTP for custom files
### ~3 months
- Developer mode
	- Can be used to see exact info being sent from client to server that is normally hidden for CLI cleanliness
	- Can also be used for debugging possible bugs
- Live video feed
- Client security
	- If an unknown connection is attempting to be made, it can be blocked and reported to the server.
## Is this meant to be malicious?
The straight answer is **no**. I do not condone this software being used to exploit other people for either the benefit of the attacker or for blackmail. This was made for a friend of mine who finds humor in being messed with and I intend to keep it that way. It should never be hidden from the client that the software is running on their computer. This can also be noted from the KV in the name, which stands for *"Kasean Virus"* which also used to be known as *"The dumbasses virus"* as that is a running joke with this person.
